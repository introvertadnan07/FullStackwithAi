# FullStack with AI

This repo is my personal learning journey to become a **Full Stack Developer with AI skills**.  
I’m starting from Python fundamentals and will slowly move toward backend, frontend, databases, and AI integrations.

The goal is simple:  
Build a strong base → create real projects → use AI in full stack apps.

## 📚 What I’m Learning Here

Right now this repo focuses on Python basics.  
Later I’ll extend it to full stack + AI topics.

Current focus:

- Python setup & basics  
- Data types and variables  
- Strings and string operations  
- Conditions (`if / elif / else`)  
- Loops (`for`, `while`)

Planned next steps (future folders):

- Functions & modules  
- File handling  
- OOP in Python  
- Basic DSA (lists, stacks, queues, etc.)  
- Web dev (HTML, CSS, JS, React)  
- Backend (Node/Express or Django/FastAPI)  
- Databases (MongoDB / SQL)  
- AI integrations (Python ML, APIs, AI tools)

More folders will appear as I progress.
